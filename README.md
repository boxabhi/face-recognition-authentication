# Face Recognition Authentication System

A simple and powerful face recognition authentication system built with HTML5, JavaScript, and Python (optional for backend). This system allows users to log in and register using their face as a biometric authentication method. It uses webcam access to capture and process face data, enabling secure and seamless user authentication.

## Features

- **Face Registration**: Capture your face using the webcam for registration.
- **Face Login**: Login using your face, ensuring a secure authentication process.
- **Camera Access**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to access webcam.
- **Image Capture**: Capture face images in real-time for biometric recognition.
- **Easy to Integrate**: Simple frontend interface ready to be integrated with any backend.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A web browser that supports HTML5 and webcam access (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Backend (optional): If you want to integrate the face recognition with a backend API (e.g., Python Flask/Django or Node.js), make sure to set up your backend to handle POST requests with face data.

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-auth.git

   Open the index.html file in your browser to start using the system.

    ```



Optionally, integrate it with your backend API for face data processing and user authentication.

### Backend Setup (Optional)
If you want to integrate the face recognition system with a backend API, you can use the following technologies:

    Python (Django/Flask)
    Machine Learning/Deep Learning (for actual face recognition, such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, or dlib)
    Usage
    Open the index.html file in your browser.
    Click on Capture Face to register a new face.
    Click on Login to authenticate using the captured face.
    The face image is sent to the backend (if implemented) for verification.
    Technologies Used
    HTML5
    CSS3
    JavaScript
    WebRTC (for accessing the webcam)
    Canvas API (for capturing images)
    Face Recognition (Optional for Backend)
